The graph data they are storing has become so large, that ordinary office screens are simply no longer big enough to display all of it at once.\r\n\r\n> Your mission, Marlon, should you decide to accept it, is to build a web compoment that can visualize a graph database without the client needing to keep the entire graph in memory or on screen. In addition, this has to be a user-friendly experience. The catch: You have less than one mythical man-month of time.\r\n\r\n> As always, should you or any of your I.M. Force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.\r\n\r\nApart from maybe that last sentence, that was pretty much the gist of my first assignment on the Vaadin team last year. Needless to say, I accepted.\r\n\r\n## An Add-on Is Born\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## Like Server, Like Client\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## Ill Communications\r\nTODO\r\n","tagline":"Highly interactive graph data visualization","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
